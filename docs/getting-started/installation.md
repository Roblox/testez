*In the future, TestEZ will have pre-built model files for use within Roblox without other tools.*

### Method 1: Rojo (Roblox)
* Copy the `src` directory into your codebase
* Rename the folder to `TestEZ`
* Use [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) to sync the files into a place

### Method 2: Wally (Roblox)
* TestEZ is available with [Wally](https://wally.run/package/roblox/testez)
* [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) is prerequisite for [wally](https://wally.run/install)

### Method 3: Lemur (CI Systems)
You can use [Lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/Lemur) paired together with a regular Lua 5.1 interpreter to run tests written with TestEZ. Note that Lemur is no longer supported.
