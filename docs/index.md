TestEZ is a BDD-style testing framework for Roblox Lua.

We use TestEZ at Roblox for testing our apps, in-game core scripts, built-in Roblox Studio plugins.

It provides an API that can run all of your tests with a single method call as well as a more granular API that exposes each step of the pipeline.
